Snowfall

The simplest projection mapping project possible written on 2014-12-24 to make it snow for my kids on Christmas. Derived

This was projected onto a grove of trees about 80 feet wide and collision bounds were traced directly onto the branches
while running.

* Press o to hang orniments on the trees
* Press c to clear the collision bounds and to let the snow fall
